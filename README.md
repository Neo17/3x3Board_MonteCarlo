# 3x3Board_MonteCarlo
Python project -- Implements Monte Carlo Tree search to solve any 3x3 board (zero sum game)

General Game Playing provides a framework through which the multiple agents play and provide the best performance in the real-time game simulation. The main goal of the "general game playing" is to design an intelligent system that can play with different types of games skillfully.

The whole idea is based and uses Monte Carlo an evaluation of the static and time consuming Minimax type of algorithms.

Project is tested on Tic-Tac-Toe and reverse Tic-Tac-Toe but with minimal modifications in is possible to use it for any zero sum 3x3 (2 player) game. 

In order to run the GUI based simulator you need to run GUI.py after downloading all the python files .
