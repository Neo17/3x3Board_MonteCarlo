# 3x3Board_MonteCarlo
Python project -- Implements Monte Carlo Tree search to solve any 3x3 board (zero sum game)

General Game Playing provides a framework through which the multiple agents play and provide the best performance in the real-time game simulation. The main goal of the "general game playing" is to design an intelligent system that can play with different types of games skillfully.

The whole idea is based and uses Monte Carlo an evaluation of the static and time consuming Minimax type of algorithms.
